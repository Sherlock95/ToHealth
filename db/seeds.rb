# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
#User.create(userName: "ReedLawrence", firstName: "Reed", lastName: "Lawrence", password: "RL")
#User.create(userName: "JarrettLocke", firstName: "Jarrett", lastName: "Locke", password: "JL")
#User.create(userName: "BrevenHettinger", firstName: "Breven", lastName: "Hettinger", password: "BH")
